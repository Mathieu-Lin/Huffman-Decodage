                ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND                          Lewis Carroll               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 2.9                            CHAPTER I                      Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sisteron the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she hadpeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had nopictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whetherthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the troubleof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a WhiteRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alicethink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say toitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thoughtit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to havewondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started toher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had neverbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch totake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across thefield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it popdown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.  In another moment down went Alice after it, never onceconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not amoment to think about stopping herself before she found herselffalling down a very deep well.  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for shehad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and towonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to lookdown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark tosee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, andnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  Shetook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it waslabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment itwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killingsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as shefell past it.  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, Ishall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'llall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likelytrue.)  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `Iwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Letme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in herlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY goodopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one tolisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitudeor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words tosay.)  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall rightTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among thepeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, Ithink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, thistime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shallhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she triedto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're fallingthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And whatan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'llnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soonbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, Ishould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll rememberher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you weredown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, butyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to getrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort ofway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Dobats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer eitherquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She feltthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that shewas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her veryearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat abat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap ofsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in amoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before herwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still insight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear itsay, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how lateit's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned thecorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she foundherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lampshanging from the roof.  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up theother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,wondering how she was ever to get out again.  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made ofsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of thedoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, orthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any ofthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a lowcurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a littledoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden keyin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a smallpassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down andlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander aboutamong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, butshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even ifmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be ofvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wishI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I onlyknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way thingshad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very fewthings indeed were really impossible.  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so shewent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key onit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up liketelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`whichcertainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neckof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'beautifully printed on it in large letters.  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise littleAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll lookfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';for she had read several nice little histories about children whohad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasantthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rulestheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot pokerwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut yourfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she hadnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner orlater.  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice venturedto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sortof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roastturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finishedit off.     *       *       *       *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *       *     *       *       *       *       *       *       *  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting uplike a telescope.'  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, andher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the rightsize for going though the little door into that lovely garden.First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she wasgoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous aboutthis; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in mygoing out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should belike then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle islike after the candle is blown out, for she could not rememberever having seen such a thing.  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decidedon going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! whenshe got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little goldenkey, and when she went back to the table for it, she found shecould not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainlythrough the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of thelegs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she hadtired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down andcried.  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice toherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she veryseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself soseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she rememberedtrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a gameof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curiouschild was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's nouse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectableperson!'  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying underthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, onwhich the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creepunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and Idon't care which happens!'  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Whichway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head tofeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised tofind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generallyhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into theway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in thecommon way.  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.     *       *       *       *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *       *     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
